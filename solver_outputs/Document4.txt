The phrase became popularized by William Shakespeare when he used it in Hamlet in the early 1600s, though earlier English versions appeared as "A dogge hath a day" in Richard Taverner's 1539 translation of Erasmus' Adages (The Stunt Dog Guy/No Sweat Shakespeare)

THEME:
The book originated from Eric Carle's use of a hole puncher on papers at his desk, which reminded him of a worm - his editor Ann Beneduce suggested changing it from "A Week with Willi the Worm" to a caterpillar, and Carle immediately shouted "Butterfly!" (Wikipedia/Penguin UK)
The book was originally printed in Japan due to high US publishing costs caused by the die-cut holes in the pages, and Eric Carle intentionally used "cocoon" instead of the scientifically correct "chrysalis" because his father used to tell him to "come out of your cocoon" as a child. (Wikipedia)
